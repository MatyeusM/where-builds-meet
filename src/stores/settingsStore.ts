/**
 * How the application behaves, as opposed to what it calculates.
 *
 * The distinction is whether a value reaches a measurement. The development toggle and the layout
 * preview change which paths, builds and locales are reachable and how the page is drawn; neither
 * appears in a calculation's inputs, so neither belongs beside the weapons and ping, which do. The
 * values that do live in `loadoutStore`, because `MeasurementContext` in
 * `rotationCalculationBundle.ts` calls that group `environment` and hashes it into the cache key.
 *
 * Read with selectors, like `loadoutStore` and unlike the calculation cache in `dpsStore`. Every
 * mutator stores what it sets, so state and storage cannot drift apart.

   * this one, because the path a saved session resolves to depends on the development toggle.
   *
   * `compactViewport` is passed in rather than read here because the viewport is not a stored
   * value: it is a live media query that `App` already subscribes to, and reading it twice would
   * mean two subscriptions to the same query.
