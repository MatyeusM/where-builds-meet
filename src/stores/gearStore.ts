/**
 * The builds the user has and the gear they are made of, and which path may see each.
 *
 * Preset and user-defined builds are one list, and the gear inventory is shared between all of
 * them — a build records which item ids it equips rather than carrying copies — so they are
 * stored as one record and held here as one value. Editing a build and editing the inventory are
 * the same act of storing the list, which is why they do not drift apart here.
 *
 * `activeBuildId` is the legacy single-selection field inside that record. It is not stored:
 * persistence is the per-path map below, which a build list cannot express because a session has
 * one active build per path rather than one overall. The two are the same fact at two levels, so
 * the mutators that move one move both.
 *
 * `scope` is authoritative over both lists, which is why the two filter sites read it through the
 * selectors at the foot of this store rather than filtering the entries themselves. It is kept
 * here rather than beside the records because placing a new build and storing the build list are
 * one act, and a caller that did one without the other would leave a build no path can see.
 *
 * Read with selectors, like `rotationStore` and unlike the calculation cache in `dpsStore`. Every
 * mutator stores what it sets, so state and storage cannot drift apart.
