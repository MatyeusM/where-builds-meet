 * not interchangeable. `dpsStore` is non-reactive on purpose: its entries are the output of
 * dispatched work, so a component that subscribed to one would re-render whenever a calculation
 * it never asked for reported progress. What lives here is published state that the interface
 * genuinely mirrors — a headline number, a rotation name, a progress bar — so it is read
 * reactively. Reaching for a selector on `dpsStore` returns nothing because nothing subscribes.
