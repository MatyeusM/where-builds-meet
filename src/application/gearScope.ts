/**
 * Which builds and which inventory each path can see.
 *
 * One record holds both settings and both maps, because they are one decision: a map is
 * meaningless while its setting is shared, and turning a setting off writes a map in the same
 * act. Sharing is the default and a session with no stored scope shares both, so an existing
 * session keeps seeing one inventory and one build list on every path without a migration.
 *
 * The maps record exclusivity and nothing else. A shared build or item has no entry, because
 * "every path can see this" and "each of the eleven arrays names this" are two encodings of one
 * fact that could disagree, and only the first survives a path being added. Turning a setting
 * back on therefore keeps the map it had, so an excursion into sharing stays reversible.
