/**
 * Resolving a rotation's results instead of running a sweep over them.
 *
 * Every part of a rotation's result is a cache entry keyed by the fingerprint of the bundle it
 * came from, and every merge of those parts is a pure function of them. So a result is a
 * derivation rather than a computation that has to be run in order: a caller asks for the
 * categories it displays, the store answers the ones it already holds, and the rest are
 * dispatched. Nothing needs to stay alive between the parts, which is what lets the rotation
 * editor be a view over the store rather than the thing that owns the calculation.
 *
 * A baseline is asked for on its own, because that is all the rest of the application displays.
 * The comparison categories are asked for by the editor, because nothing outside it reads them.
