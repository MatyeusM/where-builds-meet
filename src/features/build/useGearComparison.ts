 * What one item would do to the build that has the equipped item in this slot.
 *
 * A single-slot swap is a build whose loadout names a different item, so it is measured through
 * the same path as any other build rather than as a variant of a baseline. That matters: a swap
 * re-resolves the sheet, including the armour set tiers whose four points the swapped piece
 * competes for, so a variant that only patched the stats would be measuring a sheet the game
 * cannot produce.
 *
 * The swap is written the way `equip` writes it, because that is the state clicking Equip reaches.
 * An item is never in two slots, so moving one has to take it out of wherever it was.
 *
 * That equivalence holds for a build whose `equipped` map is what the sheet is read from, which is
 * every build a reader can equip gear on. A preset is the exception and not a near miss:
 * `resolveBuildInventory` reads the preset's own gear rather than the map, so the swap resolves to
 * the same sheet as the reference and every candidate would read `0` — a number, where the honest
 * answer for an unmeasured candidate is nothing. The inventory is closed on those builds, so no card
 * is ever asked about one; the precondition is stated here so that closing them stays a deliberate
 * rule rather than something that would break silently if a panel were opened on a preset.

/**
 * A swap that is written once and handed back unchanged until something it was built from moves.
 *
 * `measurementFor` recognises a bundle it already holds by comparing the build it was given, so a
 * caller that rebuilt the swap on every render would make every candidate look new and no bundle
 * would ever be reused. That is exactly what a scroll does: the cards on screen change, and with
 * them every swap. Held per item, the swap for a card still on screen survives the cards around it
 * appearing and leaving, so the one that arrives is the only thing that costs a bundle.
 *
 * Keyed on the build weakly, so the swaps are dropped with the build they were made from, and
 * checked against the slot, since a swap is a function of both.

 * The equipped item is never a candidate of itself; it is the reading everything else is weighed
 * against, and the card says so in words instead of showing it a difference of zero.
 *
 * The build has to be one whose `equipped` map names the gear it wears. A preset does not, and a
