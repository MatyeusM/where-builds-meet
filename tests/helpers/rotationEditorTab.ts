 * Opens the rotation editor tab and waits for it to render.
 *
 * The editor is loaded on demand, so opening its tab suspends while its module arrives, and that
 * module resolves on the real event loop — which the fake clock these tests run on does not drive.
 * Loading it here and then letting the suspended render finish is what makes the editor available
 * to assert against. Anything that opens the editor awaits this rather than assuming the editor is
 * already on screen, which is the one behaviour deferring the module changed.
