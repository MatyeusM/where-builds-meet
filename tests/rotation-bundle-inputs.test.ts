/**
 * A rotation's own inputs have to reach the bundle the worker calculates, and they used to
 * reach it from inside the rotation editor rather than from the assembly the whole application
 * shares. That is a duplication that fails silently: the editor resolved the flag and the
 * Endurance wiring on the way past, and moving that code elsewhere would have dropped both
 * without a type error, a failing test, or a changed DPS baseline, because the DPS guard
 * measures preset rotations through `graduation.ts` rather than through this assembly.
 *
 * So these are behavioural: they read the effects a bundle actually carries, through
 * `measurementSubject`, which is the production projection from a build to a subject. The
 * fixture environment selects the `Fire` Divinecraft, whose authored effect has damage-event
 * rules, so "the flag reached the bundle" is observable as that effect being present whole or
 * reduced rather than as a boolean somewhere.
